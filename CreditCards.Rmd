Question: Do restaurants which accept credit cards get better reviews on Yelp?

Cleaning the data:
```{r include=FALSE}
dir <- "C:\\Users\\Tina\\Documents\\_School\\stat133\\stat133-spring2016\\"
businessesmini <- stream_in(file(paste(dir,"businessesmini.json",sep="")))
businesses <- stream_in(file(paste(dir,"yelp_academic_dataset_business.json",sep="")))
categories <- businesses$categories

#Make a vector with the unique business id's for all the rows where 'categories' contains 'Bubble Tea' or 'Tea Rooms'
restaurants <- c()
for (i in 1:length(categories)) {
  if (sum(grepl("Restaurants",categories[[i]]) > 0)) {
    restaurants <- c(restaurants,businesses[i,1])
  }
}

#Select the rows in the data frame where the row number is in tearooms
businessesnarrow <- data.frame(businesses$business_id,businesses$name,businesses$stars,businesses$attributes$"Parking",businesses$attributes$"Wi-Fi",businesses$attributes$"Outdoor Seating",businesses$attributes$"Good For",businesses$attributes$"Accepts Credit Cards",businesses$attributes$"Price Range")
restaurants_frame <- businessesnarrow %>%
  filter(businesses.business_id %in% restaurants)
#Remove strange formatting in names
names(restaurants_frame) <- c("business_id","name","stars",names(restaurants_frame)[4:8],"Wi_Fi","Outdoor_Seating",names(restaurants_frame)[11:16],"Credit_Cards","Price_Range")

restaurants_frame <- na.omit(restaurants_frame)
```

#Credit card plots

```{r echo=FALSE}
means <- aggregate(stars ~ Credit_Cards, restaurants_frame, mean)

rating_distrib_plot <- restaurants_frame %>% ggplot(aes(y=stars, x=Credit_Cards))
rating_distrib_plot <- rating_distrib_plot + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x="Accepts Credit Cards", title="Rating distrubution for restaurants which accept and do not accept credit card") +
  stat_summary(fun.y=mean, geom="point") +
  geom_text(data=means, aes(label=stars, y=stars + .1))

rating_distrib_plot
lm(restaurants_frame$stars~restaurants_frame$Credit_Cards) 
```
correlation between stars and having credit cards: -0.3248

#significance testing
```{r}
takesCard <- restaurants_frame %>%
  filter(Credit_Cards==TRUE)
takesCardVector<- takesCard$stars
takesCardSample <- sample(takesCardVector, 450)

notTakeCard <- restaurants_frame %>%
  filter(Credit_Cards==FALSE)
notTakeCardVector <- notTakeCard$stars
notTakeCardSample <- sample(notTakeCardVector, 450)

t.test(takesCardSample, notTakeCardSample, paired=TRUE)
```

#Histogram of now many restaurants accept credit card and don't
```{r}
restaurants_frame %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=stars)) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(fill=Credit_Cards), binwidth = .5, position="dodge") + 
  labs(fill="Accepts Credit Card", x="Stars", y="Count", title="Number of Restaurants which Accept Credit Cards and Not")

```
