Price and Reviews
========================================================

Question: Do expensive restaurants get better reviews on Yelp?

```{r include=FALSE}
#Load packages
library(DataComputing)
library(httr)
library(jsonlite)

#Load the files
##replace dir path with location of files on your computer
dir <- "/Users/amaliaskilton/Documents/Coursework/2015-16/133/Final/"
businesses <- stream_in(file(paste(dir,"yelp_academic_dataset_business.json",sep="")))
categories <- businesses$categories

#Make a vector with the unique business id's for all the rows where 'categories' contains 'Restaurants'
restaurants <- c()
for (i in 1:length(categories)) {
  if (sum(grepl("Restaurants",categories[[i]]) > 0)) {
    restaurants <- c(restaurants,businesses[i,1])
  }
}

#Select the rows in the data frame where the row number is in restaurants
businessesnarrow <- data.frame(businesses$business_id,businesses$name,businesses$stars,businesses$attributes$"Parking",businesses$attributes$"Wi-Fi",businesses$attributes$"Outdoor Seating",businesses$attributes$"Good For",businesses$attributes$"Accepts Credit Cards",businesses$attributes$"Price Range")
restaurants_frame <- businessesnarrow %>%
  filter(businesses.business_id %in% restaurants)
#Remove strange formatting in names
names(restaurants_frame) <- c("business_id","name","stars",names(restaurants_frame)[4:8],"Wi_Fi","Outdoor_Seating",names(restaurants_frame)[11:16],"Credit_Cards","Price_Range")
```

Yelp defines four price categories for restaurants. This frequency polygon shows the distribution of reviews within each price category.
```{r, echo = FALSE}
#Price range plots: Frequency polygon
price_range_labels <- c("1" = "$", "2" = "$$", "3" = "$$$", "4" = "$$$$", "NA" = "No Range")
q <- restaurants_frame %>% ggplot(aes(x=stars,y=..density..))
q + geom_freqpoly(binwidth = .5,aes(col=as.factor(Price_Range))) + facet_grid(.~Price_Range, labeller = labeller(Price_Range = price_range_labels)) + labs(x="Stars",y="Density",title="Review Distribution by Price Range",legend="Price Range") + scale_colour_discrete(name="Price Range",labels=c("$","$$","$$$","$$$$","No Range")) + theme(plot.title=element_text(size=20),axis.title=element_text(size=15))
```

Takeaways from this graph:
- The `$$$$` category of restaurants get a few more very bad reviews (1 and 2 stars).
- But `$$$$` restaurants also get the highest proportion of 4-star and above reviews. 
- The proportion of 4-star and above reviews monotonically increases with price category. People do give overall better reviews to more expensive restaurants.

A box plot is also useful for comparing the descriptive statistics across the price category groups.
```{r, echo = FALSE}
s <- restaurants_frame %>% ggplot(aes(x=as.factor(Price_Range),y=stars))
s + geom_boxplot(aes(col=as.factor(Price_Range))) + labs(x="Price Range",y="Reviews",title="Review Distribution by Price Range") + scale_x_discrete(labels = price_range_labels) + scale_colour_discrete(name="Price Range",labels=c("$","$$","$$$","$$$$","No Range")) + theme(plot.title=element_text(size=20),axis.title=element_text(size=15))
```
